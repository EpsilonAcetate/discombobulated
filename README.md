# discombobulated
A simple discord bot for helping with CMU's Hack112 hackathon (run remotely due to COVID, in Fall 2020) and TartanHacks 2021.

Functions: 
* Office hours-style queue for requesting help from event mentors
* Team registration: creates channels (text and voice) and registers a given team
* Announcement command for event organizers to broadcast information to all teams

Notes for TH devs: 
* I've left a sample `info` function with some basic functionality, for any new functions you would like to add.
* To run the bot, you need a token.json with the bot's secret token. I've given the token to Keiffer. PLEASE do not push the token.json to the repo. 
* Only one person should run the bot at a time. 
* Feel free to ask me if you have any questions.
