Documentation? What's that? I only read the course notes. Anyway, here's some help with command syntax.

`!help` -- displays this text
`!ask [description of your problem]` -- adds your question to a queue which the TAs will be going through (akin to the OH Queue).

admin help:
!rt name:`team_name` [list of pings for users on team]
or equivalently
!register_team with the same syntax

!announce \`\`\` your announcement \`\`\`
